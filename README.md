# Hotel Management system

**Note:** This is a  program that imitates a hotel management system<br />
<br />
 Hotel Management system (in Python) is a simple console application, based on a Character User Interface. This project is used for hotel booking for individual accounts. In this CUI application, we have tried to keep the language highly user friendly so that the user is properly directed through the steps of booking their hotel rooms. At the same time, we have also tried to maintain all the possibilities which may help the user to book his/her hotel efficiently.
